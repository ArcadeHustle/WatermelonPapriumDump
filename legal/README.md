# Pseudo-Legal opinion

The lines between "reference and inspiration", and "swiping and plagiarism" can be murky as CodieKitty notes in ['Swipe-rium'](https://codiekitty.com/MOREC/wmswiping.htm). A goal of this project is to be able to provide commentary on the theory that some of Paprium's IP is borrowed from Sega, SNK, and other historic gaming sources.<br> 

There has been a long raging debate about how much of the Paprium content is "stolen", vs. an "homage", or "inspired by" other games. The conversation of course has direct relevance in determining what is "fair use" vs. "infringement" with regard to use of Paprium's game assets, and game play logic.<br> 

A secondary goal of this project is to examine the security ramifications of using an STM32F4 as part of an internal copy protection dongle for a video gaming system. This protection mechanism is not only prone to failure, but also exploitation due to known glitching issues in the STM32 chipset. As a result there is a vulnerability in the ability of this protection mechanism to function as designed. Future use of a similar design would leave intellectual property at risk of disclosure. "Dumping" is common in the video game scene, specifically in the Sega Genesis & Megadrive landscape that Paprium operates within. Future indie game designers will want to avoid complicated dongle examples such as the one found within Paprium. Failure to do so can mean the release of buggy game carts, just like Watermelon Games encountered with their release of Paprium.

# Biden Executive Order
[Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy)<br>
"To address persistent and recurrent practices that inhibit competition, the Chair of the FTC, in the Chair’s discretion, is also encouraged to consider working with the rest of the Commission to exercise the FTC’s statutory rulemaking authority, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, in areas such as:<br>
...<br>
(ii)   unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items, such as the restrictions imposed by powerful manufacturers that prevent farmers from repairing their own equipment;"<br>

President Joe Biden’s latest executive order is a huge win for right to repair because it specifically calls out "unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items", just like the DT128M16VA1LT concept in Paprium imposes on any end user lucky enough to acutally obtain the game. Manufacturing errors make these games subject to failure in the near future. They need to be preserved accordingly, and end users need to be able to repair broken game cartridges.

# Nintendo effect
The current legal refrence is always Nintendo, and their deep pockets of influence<br>

[Nintendo Legal Information](https://www.nintendo.com.au/legal/information)<br>
"the limited right which the Copyright Act gives to make backup copies of computer programs does not apply to Nintendo video games."

# Console Classix

[Console Classix Legal FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20070210000356/http://www.consoleclassix.com:80/legal.php)<br>
"Yes. We have taken great pains to fulfill every letter of the law. Our images were made by our own personnel. The data was copied directly off the cartridges we own and the image was transferred using a generic EPROM reader. All of these steps were taken in accordance with the law."<br>

[Letter from NOA to Console Classix](https://web.archive.org/web/20070129105536/http://www.consoleclassix.com/letter_from_noa.php)<br>
"There is a good deal of misinformation on the Internet regarding the backup/archival copy exception. It is not a "second copy" rule and is often mistakenly cited for the proposition that if you have one lawful copy of a copyrighted work, you are entitled to have a second copy of the copyrighted work even if that second copy is an infringing copy. The backup/archival copy exception is a very narrow limitation relating to a copy being made by the rightful owner of an authentic game to ensure he or she has one in the event of damage or destruction of the authentic game, not for the purpose of acquiring financial gain. Moreover, It is well established by judicial decisions in the United States that this limited exception does not apply to game data contained in ROM semiconductor chips in video game cartridges. Therefore, whether you have already an authentic game or not, or whether you have possession of a Nintendo ROM for a limited amount of time, i.e. 24 hours, it is illegal to download and play a Nintendo ROM from the Internet.<br>

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(d)(3), Nintendo notifies Consoleclassix that its actions are illegal and may be subject to criminal prosecution and civil liability. We will be monitoring your website to see if you are in compliance with the law and reserve the right to take all steps necessary to protect Nintendo's rights. "<br>

[Response to the letter from NOA](https://web.archive.org/web/20070129104734/http://www.consoleclassix.com/letter_response.php)<br>
"We would first like to address the matter of our ROM images. Our images were created by our own personnel with a generic eprom reader. This is in obedience to section 117 of the US copyright law. This exception does, in fact, apply to data contained in ROM semiconductor chips. It was the decision of the court in the case of SONY vs. CONNECTIX that copying of software in the Playstation's ROM bios was legal. This software is contained in ROM semiconductor chips, just as the game data in Nintendo cartridges.<br>

We would also like to address the concern that we are publishing our images on the internet. This is simply untrue. We offer a client software that does connect to our server through an internet backbone. However the images are not simply available for download. When a client requests a game image, the server places this image into the client random access memory (RAM). This image is also produced in accordance with section 117 of the US Copyright Law. Our server side application tracks the images that are currently in use. This application also ensures that no more copies of a software package are in use than are in our possession. This is to ensure legal rights of our users to the game in question. Should communication between the client and the server fail, the server frees the image and the client clears the memory allocated for the game, thereby destroying the client's copy of said game. We are also granted the right to lease copies of a software in our possession, provided we also ensure the customers' rights to the original software."<br>

# Controlled Digital Lending

[A White Paper on Controlled Digital Lending of Library Books](https://controlleddigitallending.org/whitepaper)<br>
"CDL enables a library to circulate a digitized title in place of a physical one in a controlled manner. Under this approach, a library may only loan simultaneously the number of copies that it has legitimately acquired, usually through purchase or donation. For example, if a library owns three copies of a title and digitizes one copy, it may use CDL to circulate one digital copy and two print, or three digital copies, or two digital copies and one print; in all cases, it could only circulate the same number of copies that it owned before digitization"<br>

"The Internet Archive is arguing that with the Emergency Library, it’s doing exactly what all public libraries are doing, legitimately and legally, only it’s eliminated the waiting list."<br>

[Temporary National Emergency Library to close 2 weeks early, returning to traditional controlled digital lending](https://blog.archive.org/2020/06/10/temporary-national-emergency-library-to-close-2-weeks-early-returning-to-traditional-controlled-digital-lending/)<br>
"Controlled digital lending is how many libraries have been providing access to digitized books for nine years.  Controlled digital lending is a legal framework, developed by copyright experts, where one reader at a time can read a digitized copy of a legally owned library book. The digitized book is protected by the same digital protections that publishers use for the digital offerings on their own sites. Many libraries, including the Internet Archive, have adopted this system since 2011 to leverage their investments in older print books in an increasingly digital world."<br>

"Whether or not this litigation determines that Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) constitutes copyright infringement, this battle between new technology and existing channels of distribution will undoubtedly be a disruptive force in book publishing"

[Hachette v. Internet Archive](https://www.eff.org/cases/hachette-v-internet-archive)<br>
"The Internet Archive is a nonprofit digital library, preserving and providing access to cultural artifacts of all kinds in electronic form. CDL allows people to check out digital copies of books for two weeks or less, and only permits patrons to check out as many copies as the Archive and its partner libraries physically own. That means that if the Archive and its partner libraries have only one copy of a book, then only one patron can borrow it at a time, just like any other library."<br>

[My Library: Copyright and the Role of Institutions in a Peer-to-Peer World](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1267&context=facpub)<br>
"Today's technology turns every computer-every hard drive-into a library. Every household can maintain and organize a stunningly large collection of media, from music to movies to texts. But if each hard drive is a kind of library, should we give the institutions traditionally known as libraries any special consideration in copyright as we historically have done? Can we distinguish the activities of institutional libraries (whether open to the public or attached to schools or universities) from those of individuals or of bookstores?'"<br>

# First Sale Doctrine
[1854. Copyright Infringement -- First Sale Doctrine](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1854-copyright-infringement-first-sale-doctrine)<br>
"The first sale doctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 109, provides that an individual who knowingly purchases a copy of a copyrighted work from the copyright holder receives the right to sell, display or otherwise dispose of that particular copy, notwithstanding the interests of the copyright owner.

"There is also the reality that much of this preservation is driven by individuals with nostalgic and personal attachments to the games they are preserving through these methods, and it is impossible to say whether future generations will pick up the torch of private, illegal preservation or if all those ROMs will simply fade into obscurity."<br>
