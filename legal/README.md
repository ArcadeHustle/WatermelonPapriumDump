# Pseudo-Legal opinion

The lines between "reference and inspiration", and "swiping and plagiarism" can be murky as CodieKitty notes in ['Swipe-rium'](https://codiekitty.com/MOREC/wmswiping.htm). A goal of this project is to be able to provide commentary on the theory that some of Paprium's IP is borrowed from Sega, SNK, and other historic gaming sources.<br> 

There has been a long raging debate about how much of the Paprium content is "stolen", vs. an "homage", or "inspired by" other games. The conversation of course has direct relevance in determining what is "fair use" vs. "infringement" with regard to use of Paprium's game assets, and game play logic.<br> 

A secondary goal of this project is to examine the security ramifications of using an STM32F4 as part of an internal copy protection dongle for a video gaming system. This protection mechanism is not only prone to failure, but also exploitation due to known glitching issues in the STM32 chipset. As a result there is a vulnerability in the ability of this protection mechanism to function as designed. Future use of a similar design would leave intellectual property at risk of disclosure. "Dumping" is common in the video game scene, specifically in the Sega Genesis & Megadrive landscape that Paprium operates within. Future indie game designers will want to avoid complicated dongle examples such as the one found within Paprium. Failure to do so can mean the release of buggy game carts, just like Watermelon Games encountered with their release of Paprium.

# Biden Executive Order
[Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy)<br>
"To address persistent and recurrent practices that inhibit competition, the Chair of the FTC, in the Chair’s discretion, is also encouraged to consider working with the rest of the Commission to exercise the FTC’s statutory rulemaking authority, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, in areas such as:<br>
...<br>
(ii)   unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items, such as the restrictions imposed by powerful manufacturers that prevent farmers from repairing their own equipment;"<br>

President Joe Biden’s latest executive order is a huge win for right to repair because it specifically calls out "unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items", just like the DT128M16VA1LT concept in Paprium imposes on any end user lucky enough to acutally obtain the game. Manufacturing errors make these games subject to failure in the near future. They need to be preserved accordingly, and end users need to be able to repair broken game cartridges.
