# Pseudo-Legal opinion

The lines between "reference and inspiration", and "swiping and plagiarism" can be murky as CodieKitty notes in ['Swipe-rium'](https://codiekitty.com/MOREC/wmswiping.htm). A goal of this project is to be able to provide commentary on the theory that some of Paprium's IP is borrowed from Sega, SNK, and other historic gaming sources.<br> 

There has been a long raging debate about how much of the Paprium content is "stolen", vs. an "homage", or "inspired by" other games. The conversation of course has direct relevance in determining what is "fair use" vs. "infringement" with regard to use of Paprium's game assets, and game play logic.<br>

Please note that the following text is considered ["for purposes of good-faith security research"](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/techftc/2016/10/dmca-security-research-exemption-consumer-devices). This write up will give you all the knowledge, and access you need to backup and preserve your Genesis MegaDrive Paprium cart as supplied by Watermelon Games. It will also serve as an academic tome on the security ramification of Voltage Glitching the STM32F4 MCU, FPGA security through obscurity, physical protection methods, and anti tamper techniques.<br>

President Joe Biden’s latest executive order is a huge win for right to repair because it specifically calls out "unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items", just like the DT128M16VA1LT concept in Paprium imposes on any end user lucky enough to acutally obtain the game.
