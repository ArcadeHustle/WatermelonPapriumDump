Several of the URLs claimed to be "infringing material" are not at all infringing. Example 1) https://twitter.com/arcade_projects/status/1449840534932107264?s=20. This is a photo of a Git Repo in a public project that archives historic computer, and gaming consoles. The claimant does not own this. 
Example 2)
https://twitter.com/arcade_projects/status/1449221392931737608?s=20 This is a photo of a damaged Watermelon Games paprium cart being examined for repair. There is no infringement, this is basic right to repair work. 

Example 3)
https://twitter.com/arcade_projects/status/1448268490184462342?s=20 this is a photo of the box that the product comes in, and part of the product being examined for damage. Again, nothing copyrighted here to be seen. These are commodity parts manufactured my ST on a proprietary breakout board that we designed. 

"Images - Video - Audio - technology Copyright" is cited, but this is a false claim.... Website of dumped stolen assets: https://github.com/ArcadeHustle/WatermelonPapriumDump/tree/main/ChipDumps/RT809H

These assets are not "stolen" in any way. They are in fact protected by the DMCA in a number of ways. The cited GitHub page in fact cites it's legal rights: https://github.com/ArcadeHustle/WatermelonPapriumDump#pseudo-legal-opinion which is quoted below.

Please note that the following text is considered ["for purposes of good-faith security research"](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/techftc/2016/10/dmca-security-research-exemption-consumer-devices). This write up will give you all the knowledge, and access you need to backup and preserve your Genesis MegaDrive Paprium cart as supplied by Watermelon Games. It will also serve as an academic tome on the security ramification of Voltage Glitching the STM32F4 MCU, FPGA security through obscurity, physical protection methods, and anti tamper techniques.

President Joe Biden’s latest executive order is a huge win for right to repair because it specifically calls out "unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items", just like the DT128M16VA1LT concept in Paprium imposes on any end user lucky enough to acutally obtain the game.

At this time broken cartridges have no repair path. Making it subject to DMCA excemption

"This kind of stuff does not work well if the company is not in a good shape, you don't want to ship something and of course if we had everything running fine if our shop was still running I could have paid someone full time to do this servicing, it's no problem. We can even pay for the shipping is not so expensive the problem is that there is no way to do anything like so I don't want to I I I want to wait and see how things are going to happen. Then we can give a good service to the customers becasue it's not a at the moment it's not good. Like we don't the customer support. I have to shut it down like some customers they call us on the phone, it's fine, but when some people they send emails so but it's um too many people make fake requests or to get free games. It takes a lot of time people don't see that like it takes a lot of time to figure that out and uh we have nobody to do the customer support at the moment."

The company can not do repairs, or reasonably manufacturer new hardware making it subject to DMCA exemption.

"Oh there's nobody. So I got to decide if I do it, and then nothing else is done, or it's like I got to decide what I want to do like. I think it's better for now that we try to solve this situation. We try to move forward and then we when things is back on track we can fix every people's problem. But if I start handling the case one by one uh in a in a cheap way, it's not going to be good. So yeah, I'm sorry for that some cusomers are waiting and they get the personal return but like I keep saying that I cannot ship you back. There's no way like as they say oh hey but I can pay but I can pay. Even if you pay I cannot ship back to you because I have so many uh things to pay before I got to ship your things." 

USA customers have been stated to have no support options making this a valid right to repair tome of information for repairing Watermelon Games Paprium cartridges with the confines of DMCA exceptions. 

https://youtu.be/axvJSqKApdo?t=2159<br>
"If the kickstarter goes well if we get back on track I can arrange a customer service. Someone to contact every customer and fix this, yeah by the way like, a yeah, it's my the biggest issue is for people who are living in the US because um in europe uh maybe we can have a even center in paris or in germany. Some people who live around can bring their cartridge you can fix them. But um in USA it's a very big country so you can't do this easily. So he has to do he has to be some shipping or people to do it at home. We will see, we will see. I don't want to announce this thing yet because uh I'm a very um let's say I have good experience now and I'm saying something, and the next day it goes horrible."

Please note that the cited works to be removed for DMCA violation are actually considered "for purposes of good-faith security research". This write up will give you all the knowledge, and access you need to backup and preserve your Genesis MegaDrive Paprium cart as supplied by Watermelon Games. It will also serve as an academic tome on the security ramification of Voltage Glitching the STM32F4 MCU, FPGA security through obscurity, physical protection methods, and anti tamper techniques.

President Joe Biden’s latest executive order is a huge win for right to repair because it specifically calls out "unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items", just like the DT128M16VA1LT concept in Paprium imposes on any end user lucky enough to actually obtain the game. This also serves as an exception to the claims that were made. https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/

It is also questionable if the cited works are actually owned by Watermelon at all, they appear to be Sega, SNK, and Capcom assets that have been reworked. Due to this suspicion the final exception to this DMCA claim is Fair Use, because we are using the cited works in commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching or scholarship. This claim has been documented by the community here for example: https://codiekitty.com/MOREC/wmswiping.htm

Finally:
"These individuals are also harassing myself and my partner owner" is an inflated claim, the original author even goes on to revise this claim and state that it was actually only one of the mentioned individuals, by openly claiming that two people mentioned in the report were in fact NOT "harassing" him, @the_hpman and @promptnews were omitted here when Louis revised his claim and said "You haven’t" https://twitter.com/XLuis__MartinsX/status/1452434210518708226. It is clear his original claim was exaggerated, or false as a means to target the_hpman and promptnews for interacting with arcade_projects.
